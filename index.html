      <h2>The Kelley MSIS Programâ€™s Project Future</h2>
      <p>
        Project Future is an initiative led by the MS in Information Systems
        Program at the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University. This
        project aims to support small businesses and NGOs transitioning to
        online-based operations, a need that became especially critical during
        the global pandemic. Teams of student volunteers, guided by their
        professors and mentors, work directly with these organizations to
        provide technology-based consulting and solutions. The goal is to
        streamline the process of client intake, team assignment, and delivery
        of results, ensuring that both the organizations and the students
        benefit from the experience. Through Project Future, students gain
        hands-on experience in consulting, while organizations receive vital
        assistance in adapting to the digital age.
